- [ ] Server-side authorization in tRPC (not just UI)

## Progress Updates

### 2025-11-08 - Initial
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task created and planning phase complete
**Blockers**: Requires TASK-002 (UI shells) and TASK-003 (category router)
**Next Steps**: Begin implementation after dependencies complete

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Forms fully functional with validation
- [ ] Create, read, update, delete all working
- [ ] Admin-only operations properly restricted
- [ ] Responsive on all breakpoints
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] All user flows tested manually
- [ ] Error cases handled properly
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Ready for integration testing

## Notes

- Categories are foundational - must work perfectly as they're used by policies
- Consider bulk import of categories (future enhancement)
- Delete should probably be soft-delete to maintain audit trail (discuss with team)
- Consider showing category usage stats (number of policies, expenses)
- Test both admin and member views
- Empty state UI important for new organizations
